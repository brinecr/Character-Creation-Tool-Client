# Monster Fighting Simulator Client

This is the capstone project of my time at General Assembly. I wanted to push myself and really make use of all of the different tools that we had been taught. This is why I am incorporating a React front-end built with Javascript to a Django back-end built with Python.

I wanted to create an application which I would want to enjoy about be able to show to friends and have them enjoy as well. This is why I decided to go with a monster fighting simulator - as every RPG fan knows the fighting section is an important part of any dungeon crawling adventure.

## Planning Story

The first thing I took time to do was really figure out what I wanted to accomplish with this project.

I then put together a tentative schedule

1. Monday: Back End Complete + Auth + as much documentation that I can
1. Tuesday: Front-End
1. Wednesday: Front-End (make sure front end is talking to back end properly)
1.Thursday: Make things pretty, clean things up (SCSS, CSS), add extra functionality (more monsters, other attributes to characters)
